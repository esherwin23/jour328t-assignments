              The COVID-19 pandemic put a pause to the world as we knew it. College students during this time were forced to retreat back home from their campuses, and they had to adapt to a new way of life. The amount of uncertainty and lack of connection and resources caused by the pandemic brought attention to the mental health of college students.

            <p>According to data from the Journal of Health, depression among college students of different racial groups increased steadily over the past 10 years. For groups such as American Indians and Native Alaskans, depression peaked around the time of the COVID-19 pandemic.

            <p>According to the data, students identifying as “Arab” and “Multiracial” experience higher degrees of mental illness. Additionally, thoughts of self-harm, such as non-suicidal self-injury and suicidal ideation contribute the least to college student mental health.

            <p>Data shows that, overall, the percentage of students across various methods of seeking mental help remains relatively the same across all racial groups. According to the Journal, “Among those with a mental health problem, students of color generally have lower odds of help-seeking,” despite generally having higher degrees of mental illness.

            <p>Using data from the Journal of Health, I conducted an analysis to measure the correlation between students with diagnosed health conditions and past-year treatment across different racial groups. According to the data, there may be a positive correlation between the two variables measured.

            <p>
              According to the chart, informal treatments such as treatment among family and friends tends to be preferred, which aligns with the data about help-seeking. According to the Journal, “Personal stigma is associated with lower odds of help-seeking. Most notably, perceived need is associated with 8.5 times higher odds of treatment.” However, relative to other attitudes about mental health, stigma is very low. 
            </p>

            <p>
              With this data in mind, it is clear that there are disparities between college students of color when it comes to mental health, especially when it comes to finding treatment. According to the Journal, campuses may want to focus on services and programs specific to dealing with the mental health of people of color, especially as campuses return to normalcy after the pandemic.
